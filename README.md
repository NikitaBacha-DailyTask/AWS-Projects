# AWS Project 2: 
# Hosting a Static Website Using Amazon S3

Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) can be used as inexpensive object storage (think: files, images, videos, logs, etc.).  But did you know it can also be used to host a static website?  Static meaning no server-side code, but it's perfect for simple HTML, images and even some client-side scripts.

# How to Create a Static Website for Free Using Amazon S3 / Host a Static Website for Free Using Amazon S3
Host a static website on Amazon S3 for free or almost free!

 – Reviewing the Free Tier for Amazon S3 <br>
 – S3 can only host static websites (no server-side code) <br>
 – Creating a new S3 bucket to host our website <br>
 – Enabling static website hosting on the S3 bucket<br>
 – Access denied! Allowing public access to the bucket<br>
 – Updating the bucket policy to allow read access to everyone<br>
 – Creating the HTML pages for your static website<br>
